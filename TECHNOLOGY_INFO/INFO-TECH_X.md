# TECHNOLOGY INFO 
- SpaceX has two operational drone ships: `Just Read the Instructions` in the Pacific for launches from Vandenberg, and `Of Course I Still Love You` in the Atlantic for launches from Cape Canaveral. 
- An `autonomous spaceport drone ship (ASDS)` is an ocean-going vessel derived from a deck barge, outfitted with station-keeping engines and a large landing platform. Construction of such ships was commissioned by aerospace company SpaceX to allow for recovery of rocket first-stages at sea for high-velocity missions which do not carry enough fuel to return to the launch site after lofting spacecraft onto an orbital trajectory.
